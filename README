To run it with rlite (or IRATI), use a configuration file with a listen
directive similar to the following one:

	listen       80 rina_appl_name=nxginx.1 rina_dif_name=n.DIF;

where you specify the application name to register and the DIF name
to register to.

A sample ngnx configuration file, together with the configuration file
of the gateway is available in the root directory:

- rlite-nginx.conf
- rina-gw.conf
