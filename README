To build and install for RINA (e.g., rlite or IRATI), run

    $ ./conf.sh
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

To run it with RINA, use a configuration file with a listen
directive similar to the following one:

	listen       80 rina_appl_name=nxginx.1 rina_dif_name=n.DIF;

where you specify the application name to register and the DIF name
to register to.

A sample ngnx configuration file, together with the configuration file
of the gateway is available in the root directory:

- rlite-nginx.conf
- rina-gw.conf

To install the configuration files:

    $ sudo cp rlite-nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    $ sudo cp rina-gw.conf /etc/rina/

To enable/disable RINA-related nginx logs, define or undefine the
RINA_DEBUG macro in src/os/unix/ngx_socket.h.

The start.sh script can be used to run the locally built nginx binary

    $ ./start.sh

The first time starting nginx may fail because of some missing directory.
Just follow the indications and create them.
